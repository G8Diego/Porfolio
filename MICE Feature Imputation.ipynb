    "# MICE Feature Imputation\n",

    "So there appears to be quite a number of missing values everywhere, the grading for this project is done solely on the prediction made on the feature 'x_e_out' with RMSE so that should be left to be the last one filled.\n",
    "MICE is specifically designed to handle datasets with multiple variables containing missing values. MICE works by iteratively imputing missing values in each variable using regression models that include the other variables as predictors. The process is repeated multiple times to create multiple imputed datasets, and the results from these imputed datasets are combined to obtain final imputations."
